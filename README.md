"# PropertyPal" 

An Uber-type app Ive been working on fpr my Internship.

The idea is to have open houses, where a customer can say they want to take a look, and wichever real estate angent is closest can easily comminicate and meet up with them.

Using the google maps api, written in Java in Android Studio

App has 2 sides...and agent and a customer. Addresses are populated from online server using the file "api.php" and are stored in an mySql database.
